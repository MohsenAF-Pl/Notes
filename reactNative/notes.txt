plugins we need:
  react native tools --> lets us debug our app
  react native/react/redux snippet --> code snippets
  prettire --> for formatting the code
  material icon theme --> icon pack, to navigate in files easier


we use expo-cli which installs throu npm, expo is an easier way to begin and build mobile app using react native for beginners.

apparently expo has been changed a lot since this course, you need to read the docs to see the changes and learn about them.
